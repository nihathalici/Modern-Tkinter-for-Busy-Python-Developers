Modern Tkinter for Busy Python Developers

This is my repo following the book "Modern Tkinter for Busy Python Developers" by Mark Roseman.

Synopsis taken from the book:
"If you're new to Tk or creating a new program, this book will ensure you get started the right way. 

If you've used Tk before, it will help you bring your knowledge right up to date. 

And if you're updating code that may have been written years ago, you'll see step-by-step how to bring it into the modern age."
