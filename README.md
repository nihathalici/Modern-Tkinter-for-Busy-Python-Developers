# Modern Tkinter for Busy Python Developers

This is my repo following the book "Modern Tkinter for Busy Python Developers" by Mark Roseman.

Synopsis taken from the book:
"Many large commercial applications these days are web-based. In fact, web (and mobile) development sucked most of the life out of desktop user interface toolkits, which is why so many mature tools are still widely used today. 

Writing desktop applications still makes sense in many situations, whether open source projects, personal or company-internal tools, or putting together a quick front end for a specific project. These are situations where Tkinter excels."
